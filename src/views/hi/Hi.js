        if you are on this site, we probably know each other well. I haven't
        managed to pubpsh any website for years so I decided to start slowly. So
        far you can't find much here but I encourage you to check my design
        experiments. Ultimately, this page is supposed to be a collection of my
        work.
      </p>
      <p className="HiCard-info">
        To view content on this page you have to be logged in, it doesn't cost
        anything but it will help me a lot.
